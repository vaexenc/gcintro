# Nintendo Gamecube Intro Animation

### [Demo](https://gcintro.netlify.app)

The majority of the work was done in Blender, including remaking the animations from scratch. The project gets exported to glTF format and made to run in a browser using Three.js.

Unfinished, development might resume some day.
